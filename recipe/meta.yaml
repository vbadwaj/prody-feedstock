  description: |
    ProDy is a free and open-source Python package for protein 
    structure, dynamics, and sequence analysis, developed by the
    Bahar lab. It allows for comparative analysis and modeling of 
    protein structural  dynamics and sequence co-evolution. Fast 
    and flexible ProDy API is for interactive usage as well as 
    application development. ProDy also comes with several analysis 
    applications and a graphical user interface for visual analysis.
